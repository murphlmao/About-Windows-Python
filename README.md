# About-Windows-Python
Work in progress project to be able to find practically any Windows setting (and by extention their value). 

Solo, hobby project.  


Shit to add: 

Network config (IPs and shit)
network interfaces
outgoing connections

OS, edition, installation date,

firewall shit?

pc name

Hardware
    CPU
    MB
    GPU
    RAM (freq, memory)
    Storage (SSD v HDD, capacity)
    display (res, pixels, other monitor bullshit?)
    laptop or desktop
    system type (x64, x32, x86)
    all devices (printers, USB, bluetooth)

eventually transition this into a full pc autoconfiguration and sysinfo utility this might involve transferring over to something more powerful like C++. likely some bash shit too.

autoruns download, services, essentials, software, etc...

gotta get a github action runner on server tho, and get some VMs & containers hosted for testing n sheeet
